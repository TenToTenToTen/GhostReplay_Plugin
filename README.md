# 🌀 Ghost Replay System

**Ghost Replay System** is a lightweight, multiplayer-ready plugin that lets you record and replay actor animation, transforms, and materials — just like ghost cars in racing games or bloodstains in Soulslikes.

It supports both Static and Skeletal Meshes, full pose fidelity (including IK, cloth, and groom), and offers optional compression and quantization to keep replay data lightweight — perfect for multiplayer synchronization without overloading the network.

Designed for ease of use, it works out of the box with existing projects and includes fully-Blueprint controls for spawning, playback, and customization.

Whether you're building death replays, tutorial ghosts, or story moments, Ghost Replay System makes immersive, in-world playback easy.

## 🔍 What Sets It Apart
- ✅ **Multiplayer-aware from the ground up** — Efficiently synchronizes replay data without flooding the network.
- ✅ **Fully modular** — No need to modify your existing animation systems or blueprints; plug and play.
- ✅ **Replay accuracy with performance in mind** — Uses `FAnimInstanceProxy` for threaded animation evaluation and quantized transform storage for minimal bandwidth impact.
- ✅ **Visual separation with orchestration** — Server and client replay actors are clearly separated between data orchestrators and visual ghosts, reducing replication load and improving clarity.
